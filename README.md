# Project Proposal
Project Name: Trip Planner

What and Why:
It can be time consuming to plan a trip. In addition to the time spent on looking for appropriate tourist attractions, one also needs to search for hotel and transportation based on the budget. The Trip Planner software is designed to resolve the complex issue of arranging trips. Based on users' preferences, it will automatically generate several best plans for users to choose from. By analyzing data on local restaurants, tourist attractions and hotels, the software will take into account factors such as the ranking of tourist attractions, the location of hotel and the time spent on the way. After the analysis, the plans generated will ideally have a precision in terms of hoursï¼Œbeing able to guide users smoothly from one place to another during their entire stay. 

For whom:
Given the description above, the customers for this app would by anyone who needs a trip to relax, which is a relatively huge group.

How:
From my understanding, this software will be composed of three major parts: the user interface, the data base and the selection algorithm. 
Firstly, the user interface will be able to take a wide range of inputs from users, such as their planning date of departure and return, the destination, the budget, the type of tourist attractions they are interested in(natural scenes or cultural attractions)... Then, after users hit "plan", the interface should be able to return several sets of results each containing a local map marked by the items chosen along with the corresponding daily schedule. Then, users will be able choose their favourite plan and make further modifications, such as changing a tourist attraction, based on the plan selected. Finally, the user should be able to save the plan to their local device. 
In addition, a data base is needed which contains information(such as location, rating and costs) of tourist attractions, restaurants and hotels. It should be able to download these information from the internet and refresh periodically.
Last but not least, a selection algorithm is needed. It will take the user inputs as parameters and produce the best plans based on the information stored in the data base. 

Scope:
In this project, all the three compositions mentioned above are challenging to some degree. We would need an elaborate user interface which enables the users to enter their preferences as detailed as possible, a data base which deals with a huge amount of data in different dimensions, and an efficient selection algorithm which chooses the best plans from all possible combinations of activties. However, given that we work in groups, it should be achieveable if the work is divided up and each group member works on one specific composition during the whole semester.
